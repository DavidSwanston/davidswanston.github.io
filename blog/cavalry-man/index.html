          <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Cavalry Manual interactive is part of the Armoury in Action gallery at the tower of London. The interactive is based on a British cavalry training manual from the Napoleonic Wars (Le Marchant's Rules and regulations for the sword exercise of the cavalry of 1796) and allows the player to practise the 6 recognised cuts from the manual.</p>
<p>The game consists of two sections. In the first section the player must perform all 6 cuts on static targets, and in the second section the player is mounted on a moving horse and must time their cuts to hit targets as they approach them.</p>

<em>instructions</em></p>
<p>The interactive was originally designed and built by another studio using a tethered sword with embedded motion control. This proved to be unreliable after install, the technology in the sword was more fragile than expected and didnâ€™t hold up to public use and abuse.</p>
<p>My task was to recreate the interactive from the ground up, in a more robust format. I decided on using a Microsoft Kinect V2 for gesture tracking. This meant the expensive tethered sword could be swapped for a cheap foam sword, which could easily be replaced and was less likely to cause damage to any surrounding exhibits if the player got carried away.</p>
<p>This project was a steep learning curve, it was the first major project I had done in Unity, and also my first time using the Kinect API. However it was well received and is still in use 7 years later.</p>
